pygames - Teachers like it but it has alot of set up

Created pyZero runs on Raspberry Pi simple commands and input from mouse and keyboard.

Working on making simpler tools to get setup quickly

Zero - PyGame
GPio
Network
Mu (an editor)

All based on existing body of work
Gives relavant error messages for new coders

MicroPython - python 3

microbit being given to students in UK

microbit.co.uk has informaiton and web programming tools

if you dont' want to code online you can download Code with Mu

to support they created pyconic.github.io
python commic
microbit World Tour

Program Arcade Games
by Paul Vincent Craven

Website with worksheets and quizzes

Made Amazon Create Space, self published

Camtasia used to edit Audio

--------------------------------------------------------------
PyGame Library
Mature and Well Known
SDLI C++ Library
Dev has stagnate
Website has issues

Arcade is Open GL and Pyglet
makes it easier to use than PyGame

Grok Learning
40,000 failed attempts at writing Hello World

Programming Competition
teach everything you need to know to compete

punctionation is biggest cause of errors
Wrong words, or no output

of 1015 who got a Syntax Erro only 465 stayed 
Name Error 306 129 

These two errors turn people off from programing

Running Code 
avg of 10 attempts
32% ended in errors
Syntax errors 17% of time

Name Error:
var1= input('What is your name?')
print('Hello', var2)

or
input('What is your name?')
print(input)


Hello Name is significantly more difficult than Hello World

see error feels like a stop sign 

teacher has board of errors. Add as you find a new one.
Then talk about how to solve it if you find it.

Blockly + Python

Variables are hard for students to grasp

Montessori

College - focuses on langauge not on solving problems
Welcome to Django online classes

Teachers
1. Materials (book, game, blocks)
2. Classmates (peers. Learning with someone exchanging experiences)
3. Tutor (obseve enviroment, address when students struggle)

materials - autocorrection
we can write code to fix code. 100% test driven

no tests/grades 
Stats for how much time spent and which milestone reached, but no grades
Build incrementally one step at a time

Enviroment should empower me (shouldn't require me to memorize things to be successful)

Ubuntu - most used platform so they can find answers.

can guide through host stack

Content is an obstacle
Students present to who they will be in the future.
small pills to help students
Learn it now try this

5 min video, try this, 5 more, try it.

Share what they are learning.

Equity

Afterschool childcare 
if they want to stay after school they can't get to daycare
hinderance to participation 

Afer School
at YMCA, Boys & Girls Club, and KCLS

Kids can't type (but have smartphones and compent)

Leave room for internationalization if making educational tech
Parents care, but need in home language

Beforehand
--What are the steps for background check
--What materials are avilable (often outdated, locked down, internet restricted)
	If need to register with email address don't work due to National laws about child safety

	
Tye your Curriculum to Standards to make it easier to adapt into school enviroment
Common Core
K12 CS.org
CS Unplugged.org
--whole set of unplugged activities with deck of cards

ozobot - reacts to color of line you draw. 
Ozoblockly can then be programed
hold robot up to screen to download program and it flashes colors

then pseduo code
with decks of cards
write rules
then replace spaces with _
add if and elif 
then go read eachothers game and play

Pitch:
Why you're an OK
	I've been approved with my background check
Value of learning
	How coding links to education 		
What the school needs to do
	Make sure _____ is unblocked
What materials you'll need
	I just need space 
I've been thinking about equity of access and opprotunity
